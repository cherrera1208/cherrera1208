Hi, My name is Carlos
===============================
Full-stack web developer
------------------------
I have a background in naval aviation as an avionics technician and spent a number of years working in property management around greater Seattle before making the transition into software development. I have experience working in team environments and enjoy working on projects where I can utilize my creativity and problem solving skills. I am a quick learner and am always looking for opportunities to learn new technologies.
